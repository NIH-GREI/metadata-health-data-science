abstract: '<p>Data dump from the Research Organization Registry (ROR), a community-led
  registry of open identifiers for research organizations.</p>

  <p>Release v1.59 contains ROR IDs and metadata for 113119 research organizations
  in JSON and CSV format, in schema versions 1 and 2. This includes the addition of
  1311 new records and metadata updates to 238 existing records.<a href="https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/releases/tag/v1.59">
  See the release notes</a>.</p>

  <h2>Data format</h2>

  <p>Beginning with release v1.45 on 11 April 2024, data releases contain JSON and
  CSV files formatted according to both <a href="https://github.com/ror-community/ror-schema/blob/master/ror_schema.json">
  schema v1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ror-community/ror-schema/blob/schema-v2-1/ror_schema_v2_1.json">schema
  v2</a>. v2 files have `_schema_v2` appended to the end of the filename, ex v1.45-2024-04-11-ror-data_schema_v2.json.
  In order to maintain compatibility with previous releases, v1 files have no version
  information in the filename, ex v1.45-2024-04-11-ror-data.json</p>

  <p>For both versions, the CSV file contains a subset of fields from the JSON file,
  some of which have been flattened for easier parsing. As ROR records and the ROR
  schema are maintained in JSON, CSVs are for convenience only. JSON is the format
  of record.</p>

  <h2>Release versioning</h2>

  <p>Beginning with v1.45 in April 2024, ROR has introduced schema versioning, with
  files available in <a href="https://github.com/ror-community/ror-schema/blob/master/ror_schema.json">schema
  v1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ror-community/ror-schema/blob/schema-v2-1/ror_schema_v2_1.json">schema
  v2</a>. The ROR API default version, however, remains v1 and will be changed to
  v2 in April 2025. To align with the API, the data dump major version will remain
  1 until the API default version is changed to v2. At that time, the data dump major
  version will be incremented to 2 per below.</p>

  <p>Data releases are versioned as follows:</p>

  <ul>

  <li><strong>Minor versions (ex 1.1, 1.2, 1.3):</strong>&nbsp; Contain changes to
  data, such as a new records and updates to existing records. No changes to the data
  model/structure.</li>

  <li><strong>Patch versions (ex 1.0.1):</strong>&nbsp; Used infrequently to correct
  errors in a release. No changes to the data model/structure.</li>

  <li><strong>Major versions (ex 1.x, 2.x, 3.x):</strong>&nbsp; Contains changes to
  data model/structure, as well as the data itself. Major versions will be released
  with significant advance notice.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>For convenience, the date is also include in the release file name, ex: v1.0-2022-03-15-ror-data.zip.</p>
